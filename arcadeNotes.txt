As users playing a two player game we want to:

    1.  enter our names and have them displayed
    2.  have our order chosen for us by the game
    3.  take turns by dropping our chip into a column on the grid
    4.  not be able to drop a chip into a totally filled column
    5.  be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
    6.  start the game over without having to reset the browser

As a user playing a single player game I additionally want to:

    1.  see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
    2.  have the Computer player choose columns as if it were a human player

As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

    the Computer chooses the correct column for a win, when possible -->
